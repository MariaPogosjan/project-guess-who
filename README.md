# Project Name

This task was to create a Guess Who game made with javascript, where the users plays against the computer. 

## The problem
I had some problems with understanding how to compare the attributes if the currentQuestion matches the attributes in the secret or not. I solved my problem by discussing it with my team to understand what I had to do. Thanks to that I learned how to reach values from an array.
